# UNC Lead Exposure

The safety of water systems severely affects our life in UNC.
This project aims to help us find nearby lead exposure in water systems.

## Purpose

In last November, many of us received emails form the department about the lead tested in water fixtures of the Brooks building.

However, if we look at more details published on the university website, we'll see there're tens of buildings was reported to lead exposure.

Despite these datasets being published, the table format with complex text still makes it hard to get an at-a-glance understanding.

This website tends to visualize and explain concerns about where, when, and how lead exposure happened in UNC, to make the published dataset easier to understand.

## Usage

Preparing:
```
npm install
```

Local testing:
